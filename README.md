## Task A
Using the MIPS architecture and assembly language create a fully commented programme that allows a user to input their name (one string) and their student registration number (an integer number) and then output both to screen.

## Task B

Using the MIPS architecture and assembly language create a fully commented programme that allows a user to input the last two digits of their student registration number then divides that number by 2 and outputs the result to screen.*

## Task C

Using the MIPS architecture and assembly language create a fully commented programme that allows a user to input ANY three digit number and  then uses that number with as many nested do loops as are required to calculate the following:

 - Three digit number+ Three digit number = result
 
The “result” must NOT increment after each loop. i.e you simply repeat the same calculation time after time

Make sure that what every computer you are working on takes 30 seconds to complete all loops and calculations. This is done by progressively increasing the size of the three digit number.

At the end of the programme output ONCE the result of:

 - Three digit + Three digit number = result

If you input 999 (the largest three digit number possible) and the MIPs programme takes less than a second to run then add another nested loop. Continue to add loops until the time the programme takes to run can be altered between 5 and 30 seconds simply by adjusting the three-digit number inputted in by the user. i.e the number 999 should result in a run time of 30 seconds.

The number of nested loops required will depend on your coding efficiency and the computer system that you are working on.
